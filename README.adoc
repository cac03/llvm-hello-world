= llvm-hello-world

== Prerequisites

At least 15'th versions of `clang`, `llc`, `lli` are required.

=== Ubuntu 22.04

Run:

[source,bash]
----
# apt-get install clang-15
----

Then `clang` would be available as `clang-15` `llc` as `llc-15`, and `lli` as `lli-15`

=== Arch Linux

[source,bash]
----
# pacman -S clang llvm
----

To run with interpreter use:

[source,bash]
----
$ make hello-world-run
----

=== Other distributions

You have to figure out yourself ðŸ™‚

== Running

To run as a native executable use:

[source,bash]
----
$ make hello-world-run-executable
----

To run using an interpreter use:

[source,bash]
----
$ make hello-world-run
----

[NOTE]
====
In Ubuntu `lli`, `clang`, and `llc` must have version suffix.
So you can use make variables to override the default ones.

[source,bash]
----
$ make LLI=lli-15 LLC=llc-15 CLANG=clang-15 hello-world-run
----
